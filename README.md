## Installation

To run this game, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

### Installing Python

You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).

### Installing Pygame

You can install Pygame using pip:

```sh
pip install pygame
```

## Game Instructions
### Use the arrow keys to move the tiles.

  - **Left Arrow**: Move tiles left.

  - **Right Arrow**: Move tiles right.

  - **Up Arrow**: Move tiles up.

  - **Down Arrow**: Move tiles down.

  When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one. The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048. 
If no moves are left and the board is full, the game will display "Game Over" and restart automatically.
